## Components

1. Map Editor
#### User-driven creation of map elements: country, continent, and connectivity between countries.
- Map editor commands:
- editcontinent -add continentname continentvalue -remove continentname
- editcountry -add countryname continentname -remove countryname
- editneighbor -add countryname neighborcountryname -remove countryname neighborcountryname
- showmap (show all continents and countries and their neighbors)

#### Saving a map to a text file exactly as edited (using the “domination” game map format).
- Map editor command: savemap filename, editmap filename
- Loading a map from an existing “domination” map file to edit or create a new map from scratch if the file does not
exist.

### Verification of map correctness. 
- The map should be automatically validated upon loading and before saving (at
least 3 types of incorrect maps). The validatemap command can be triggered anytime during map editing.
- Map editor command: validatemap

2. Game Play
